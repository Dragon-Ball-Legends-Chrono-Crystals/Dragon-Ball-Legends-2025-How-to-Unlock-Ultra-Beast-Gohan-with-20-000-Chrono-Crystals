**How to Unlock Ultra Beast Gohan with 20,000 Chrono Crystals**

Unlocking Ultra Beast Gohan in Dragon Ball Legends requires some strategic planning and the right amount of Chrono Crystals. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to obtain this legendary character:

1. **Save Up 20,000 Chrono Crystals:**
   The first step to unlocking Ultra Beast Gohan is to accumulate 20,000 Chrono Crystals. These can be obtained by completing story missions, daily quests, special events, and more. You can also purchase Chrono Crystals through the in-game store if you're looking to speed up the process.

2. **Head to the Summon Banner:**
   Ultra Beast Gohan will be available through a limited-time summon banner. Once you have 20,000 Chrono Crystals, navigate to the summon section of the game. Look for the banner that features Ultra Beast Gohan and select it. Be sure to check if there are any special discounts or offers, as they can help stretch your Chrono Crystals further.

3. **Use Your Chrono Crystals to Summon:**
   Once you’ve found the correct banner, use your 20,000 Chrono Crystals to perform summons. Typically, each summon will cost 1,000 Chrono Crystals, so you’ll be able to perform up to 20 summons. Keep in mind that while Ultra Beast Gohan has a higher chance of being summoned in these events, there’s always an element of luck involved.

4. **Increase Your Odds with Multi-Summons:**
   Multi-summons give you more chances to pull Ultra Beast Gohan in one go. Each multi-summon requires 1,000 Chrono Crystals and provides multiple character pulls at once, improving your odds of unlocking the Ultra Beast Gohan.

5. **Celebrate Your New Character:**
   If luck is on your side, you’ll unlock Ultra Beast Gohan! His abilities and stats make him a great addition to your roster. If you don’t get him immediately, don’t be discouraged—keep saving your Chrono Crystals and try again.
